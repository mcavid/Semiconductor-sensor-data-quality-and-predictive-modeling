# Semiconductor Sensor Data Quality & Predictive Modeling
### Author: Mehdi Javid

This project analyzes real semiconductor manufacturing sensor data to:
- Improve **data quality**  
- Detect **anomalies and sensor drift**  
- Perform **advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
- Build **predictive models** for yield and defect classification  
- Develop a reproducible **ETL pipeline**  

The dataset comes from the **SECOM Semiconductor Manufacturing Process** (UCI Repository), which contains:
- 1567 observations  
- 590 manufacturing sensor measurements  
- Binary quality labels (Pass/Fail)

This project demonstrates skills aligned with real industrial data science workflows:
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Correlation & PCA-based dimensionality reduction  
- Feature engineering  
- Handling missing values at scale  
- Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- ML evaluation  
- Sensor anomaly detection  
- Automated ETL pipeline  
- Professional code organization
